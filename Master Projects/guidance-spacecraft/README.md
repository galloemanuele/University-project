[cite_start]This repository contains the MATLAB codebase and technical report developed for the "Spacecraft Guidance and Navigation" Assignment #1 at Politecnico di Milano[cite: 1, 2, 5]. [cite_start]The project focuses on advanced trajectory design, differential correction, and optimal control techniques across different restricted n-body dynamical models[cite: 6, 282].

## 🚀 Project Overview

The work is divided into three main assignments:

### 1. Periodic Orbits in the 3D CRTBP
* [cite_start]**Objective**: Analyze periodic halo orbits in the 3D Earth-Moon Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP)[cite: 6, 22].
* **Key Implementations**: 
  * [cite_start]High-accuracy calculation of the 5 Lagrange points and their respective Jacobi constants[cite: 11, 50].
  * [cite_start]Development of a differential correction scheme using the State Transition Matrix (STM) to find periodic halo orbits[cite: 23, 144].
  * [cite_start]Numerical continuation to compute families of halo orbits by gradually decreasing the Jacobi energy[cite: 25, 26].

### 2. Impulsive Guidance (Earth-Moon Transfer)
* [cite_start]**Objective**: Design an optimal two-impulse Earth-Moon transfer to minimize Delta-V[cite: 270, 350].
* **Key Implementations**:
  * [cite_start]First guess solution generated using the 2D Planar Bicircular Restricted Four-Body Problem (PBRFBP)[cite: 309].
  * [cite_start]Optimization using Simple Shooting (with and without analytical gradients)[cite: 278, 279, 280].
  * [cite_start]Optimization using Multiple Shooting with 4 nodes, utilizing variational equations for the Jacobian[cite: 281].
  * [cite_start]Real-world validation via full n-body propagation transformed into the Earth-centered inertial frame (ECLIPJ2000) using NASA SPICE kernels[cite: 282, 691].

### 3. Continuous Guidance (Low-Thrust Orbit Raising)
* [cite_start]**Objective**: Design an optimal low-thrust maneuver to raise a spacecraft orbit from 800 km to 1000 km[cite: 736, 737].
* **Key Implementations**:
  * [cite_start]Optimization of the trajectory to minimize the risk of impact in an environment with high spatial debris density[cite: 738, 740].
  * [cite_start]Application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) to define state dynamics, costate dynamics, and the zero-finding problem[cite: 748, 863, 876].
  * [cite_start]Numerical continuation to analyze and compare solutions with a reduced thrust level (from 3.000 N to 2.860 N)[cite: 758, 970].

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
* [cite_start]**Language**: MATLAB [cite: 33, 120]
* [cite_start]**Integrators**: `ode78` (high-order fixed-step solver for smooth dynamics) [cite: 150]
* [cite_start]**Solvers**: `fzero`, `fmincon` (active-set), `fsolve` (Levenberg-Marquardt and trust-region-dogleg) [cite: 33, 384, 890, 894, 982]
